This is a website for a fictional company called "Bread Company" that specializes in providing cutting-edge technology solutions. The website is designed to showcase the company's services on bread technology, portfolio, and contact information.

The design is modern and professional, with a focus on user experience and easy navigation. It's only one page in this case, but it should be responsive and work well on both desktop and mobile devices. The layout is clean and organized, with clear headings and sections for each part of the website.

The color scheme is a combination of warm and neutral tones, reflecting the company's commitment to quality and innovation.

Use React TSX and Tailwind to create the website. This one-pager should include the following sections:

1. **Home**: A brief introduction to the company and its mission.
2. **Services**: A detailed description of the services offered by the company, including bread technology solutions, consulting, and support.
3. **Portfolio**: A showcase of the company's previous projects and success stories.
4. **Contact**: A contact form for potential clients to reach out to the company for inquiries or quotes.

Make sure to use components effectively to enhance the user experience and maintain a clean code structure.
